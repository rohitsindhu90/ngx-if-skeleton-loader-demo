## Why skeletons?

> This is a common concept, but why use this directive instead solve it via server-side rendering?

The idea of this component is make the process transparent and easier. So the main point is integrate this component with other tooling process, such as:

- Server-side rendering;
- Progressive rendering;
- Any other that you like :)

It's totally transparent for you and you can integrate easier in your application, improving your user experience ðŸŽ‰

## Demo

Try out our [demo on Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/ngx-if-skeleton-loader-sample)!

## Install

You can get it on NPM installing `ngx-if-skeleton-loader` module as a project dependency.

```shell
npm install ngx-if-skeleton-loader --save
```

## Setup

You'll need to add `NgxSkeletonLoaderModule` to your application module. So that, the `<ngx-skeleton-loeader>` components will be accessible in your application.

```typescript
@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    YourAppComponent
  ],
  imports: [
    NgxSkeletonLoaderModule,
    ...
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [YourAppComponent]
})

export class YourAppComponent {}

```

After that, you can use the `featureToggle` components in your templates, passing the configuration data into the component itself.

- `ngx-if-skeleton-loader`: Handle the skeleton animation and the skeleton styles of your app;

```html
<div class="item"><ngx-if-skeleton-loader count="5" appearance="circle"> </ngx-if-skeleton-loader></div>
```
